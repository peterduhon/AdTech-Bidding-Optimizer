# Performance Optimization in Ad Tech Bidding

This project demonstrates optimization techniques for bidding processes in ad tech, where performance is critical, and milliseconds can make a significant difference. The project includes both an unoptimized and an optimized version of a bidding simulation, with visualizations to compare their performance.

## Features

- **Bidding Simulation:** Simulates a bidding process with network latency, using both unoptimized and optimized approaches.
- **Performance Profiling:** Includes profiling to analyze the execution time of both approaches.
- **Visualizations:** Generates comparison charts showing the execution time of the unoptimized and optimized bidding processes, as well as additional metrics.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `concurrent.futures`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
Ad Tech SQL Analysis
This project also demonstrates how to generate, store, and analyze bid data using SQLite for an ad tech environment. It simulates an ad bidding process where different advertisers bid on impressions through various Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs). The data generated is then used to perform several analytical queries to derive insights such as win rates for SSPs, top advertisers by spend, and average bid amounts over time.

Project Overview
As a Senior Product Manager in Ad Tech, understanding bidding dynamics and analyzing the data generated from programmatic auctions is crucial. This project simulates the generation of bid data, stores it in an SQLite database, and provides several SQL queries to analyze key metrics like SSP win rates, top advertisers by spend, and bid amount trends over time.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/peterduhon/SQL-Analysis.git
cd SQL-Analysis
Install Python and SQLite:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. SQLite comes pre-installed with Python.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python3 ad_tech_sql_analysis.py
Usage
The script creates a sample SQLite database (adtech.db) and populates it with synthetic bid data. It then performs a series of SQL queries to extract insights from the generated data. The queries and results are printed to the console.

Queries and Analysis
Win Rate for Each SSP
This query calculates the win rate for each SSP by averaging the win column, counting the total bids, and summing the total bid amount.

sql
Copy code
SELECT ssp_id, 
       AVG(win) as win_rate, 
       COUNT(*) as total_bids,
       SUM(bid_amount) as total_bid_amount
FROM bids
GROUP BY ssp_id;

Top 3 Advertisers by Total Spend
This query identifies the top 3 advertisers based on their total spend (only counting winning bids).

sql
Copy code
SELECT advertiser_id, SUM(bid_amount) as total_spend
FROM bids
WHERE win = 1
GROUP BY advertiser_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 3;

Daily Average Bid Amount for the Past Week
This query calculates the daily average bid amount for the past seven days.

sql
Copy code
SELECT DATE(timestamp) as date, AVG(bid_amount) as avg_bid
FROM bids
WHERE timestamp >= DATE('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;

Visualizations
This project includes visualizations for the following metrics:

Win Rate by SSP
Top 3 Advertisers by Total Spend
Daily Average Bid Amount for the Past Week
These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and performance of bids across different SSPs, advertisers, and time periods.

Closing the Connection
The script ensures that the connection to the SQLite database is properly closed after all operations are completed.

python
Copy code
conn.close()
