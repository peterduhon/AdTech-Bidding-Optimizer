# Performance Optimization in Ad Tech Bidding

This project demonstrates optimization techniques for bidding processes in ad tech, where performance is critical, and milliseconds can make a significant difference. The project includes both an unoptimized and an optimized version of a bidding simulation, with visualizations to compare their performance.

## Features

- **Bidding Simulation:** Simulates a bidding process with network latency, using both unoptimized and optimized approaches.
- **Performance Profiling:** Includes profiling to analyze the execution time of both approaches.
- **Visualizations:** Generates comparison charts showing the execution time of the unoptimized and optimized bidding processes, as well as additional metrics.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `concurrent.futures`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
